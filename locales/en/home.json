    "text": "RAAC, a company launched in late 2012, has built its foundation on three fundamental values: quality, reliability, and creativity. Initially, the focus was on executing AS9100 and ISO9001 audits for the certification body Lloyds Register on a freelance basis. However, after a few weeks, the demand for consultancy services increased, prompting RAAC to also launch consultancy services. Today, RAAC strikes a good balance between providing consultancy and auditing services, all while maintaining a steadfast commitment to quality, reliability, and creativity."
